# ansible-networking-collections

[Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/networks) supports the [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) community to manage networking devices such as the Nokia [IP product portfolio](https://www.nokia.com/networks/portfolio/ip-networks) running [SR OS](https://www.nokia.com/networks/products/service-router-operating-system).
